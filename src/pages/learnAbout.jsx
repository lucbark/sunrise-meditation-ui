                        focus. It’s a great technique that anyone can do.</li>

                        because each moment you spend focusing on something positive is one less <br></br>

                    <li>Many people breath shallower during times of stress, so learning how to breathe<br></br>

                    <ol>
                    <li>Begin by emptying your lungs. </li>
                    <li>Breathe in through your nose for 4 seconds.</li>
                    <li>Hold your breath for 7 seconds.</li>
                    <li>Exhale firmly through your mouth, pursing the lips, for 8 seconds</li>
                    <li>You may repeat this breathing cycle up to 4 times</li>
                    </ol>
                 
                    
                    <p>This type of simple technique is rejuvenating for the nervous system. If it makes you feel a little dizzy, 
                    don’t do any more than 3-4 breaths at first. This kind of breathing acts as a natural tranquilizer.</p>
                   
                    <p>Practicing this kind of simple breathing can completely shift your focus and your state of mind.</p>
